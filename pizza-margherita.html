      <li>1/2 cup lukewarm water</li>
      <li>4 cups bread flour</li>

      <li>3/4 cup cold water</li>
      <li>1/4 cup olive oil, plus more for bowl</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Preparation Time: 25mins</p>
    <p>Instructions</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat a wood-fired pizza oven to very hot 4 hours before cooking.
        Alternately, you can use a preheated pizza stone in your home oven. It's
        best to heat it for 1 hour at 500 degrees F before baking.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add tomatoes to a food processor and process until smooth. Season with
        salt.
      </li>
      <li>
        Sprinkle some flour on your pizza peel. Using a rolling pin, stretch
        your dough to a very thin 10-inch round.
      </li>
      <li>
        Using a spoon to spread, put 1/4 of the sauce on the dough, and spread
        leaving a 1-inch border. Sprinkle 1/4 of the mozzarella over the sauce.
      </li>
      <li>
        Gently put the pizza on the floor of the pizza oven. Bake until golden
        and crisp, about 3 minutes. Top with hand torn basil.
      </li>
      <p>Pizza Dough</p>
      <li>
        In the bowl of a stand mixer, add the yeast, lukewarm water, and 1/2 cup
        bread flour. Mix well and let sit until bubbly, about 30 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Whisk together the remaining 3 1/2 cups bread flour and salt in another
        bowl so it will be evenly distributed.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once the yeast mixture is nice and bubbly and looks like foamy beer, add
        3/4 cup cold water and olive oil. Using a dough hook, turn the mixer on
        and add the flour in increments.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mix the dough for about 5 minutes, until the dough starts creeping up
        the dough hook and comes away from the sides of the bowl.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place the dough in a large bowl lightly greased with olive oil. Turn to
        coat all sides of the dough with oil. Cover the bowl loosely with a
        clean tea towel. Let rise until doubled in size, about 2 hours. Punch
        dough down, and let rise another hour.
      </li>
      <li>
        Divide the dough into 4 equal disks. Lightly flour a work surface. Using
        your fingers or heels of your hands (and a rolling pin, if you prefer)
        stretch the disks out to a 10-inch round.
      </li>
      <li>Repeat with the remaining 3 pizza dough disks.</li>
