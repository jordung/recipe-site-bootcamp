    <p>Ingredients</p>
    <ul>
      <li>3 cups cold cooked white rice</li>
      <li>2 eggs</li>
      <li>1 1/2 tablespoon neutral cooking oil</li>
      <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>1 stalk scallion, finely chopped</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon light soy sauce</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon sesame oil</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1 pinch ground white pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Preparation Time: 10mins</p>
    <p>Instructions</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Loosen the rice grains as much as possible with chopsticks or a spoon.
        Lightly beat the eggs until the whites and yolks are fully incorporated.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat up an empty, well-seasoned wok over high heat until it becomes very
        hot (smoke rises). Pour in 1 tablespoon of oil then swirl it around to
        coat the side of the wok.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour in the egg. Once it begins to set at the bottom, stir to help the
        running part flow. Use a spatula to scramble quickly so that it turns
        into small pieces. Transfer out and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place the wok back on the burner. Add the remaining Â½ tablespoon of oil.
        Fry garlic until fragrant then add the rice. Stir and toss continuously
        until the rice is piping hot. Use the spatula to break any clumps.
      </li>
      <li>
        Return the egg to the wok, along with scallions. Continue frying until
        everything is heated thoroughly.
      </li>
      <li>
        Season with light soy sauce, sesame oil, salt and white pepper. Give
        everything a good stir. Dish out and serve immediately.
      </li>
    </ol>
