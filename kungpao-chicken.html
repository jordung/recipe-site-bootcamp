    <p>Ingredients</p>
    <ul>
      <li>1 teaspoon vegetable oil</li>
      <li>1 cup raw peanuts</li>
      <li>12 oz. 340g chicken breast, cut into 3/4" cubes</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon vegetable oil</li>
      <li>2 teaspoon cornstarch</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon shaoxing wine</li>
      <li>1/8 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>a pinch of ground white pepper</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon light soy sauce</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon dark soy sauce</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon rice wine vinegar</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons water</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons oil</li>
      <li>3 cloves garlic</li>
      <li>2 thin slices ginger</li>
      <li>2 dried red chilies</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon Sichuan peppercorn powder</li>
      <li>6 scallions</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Preparation Time: 30mins</p>
    <p>Instructions</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat a teaspoon of oil in a wok over medium heat and add a cup of raw
        shelled peanuts. Stir constantly (or they’ll burn) for 3 minutes. Turn
        off the heat and stir for another minute using the residual heat in the
        wok. Set aside to cool. They will turn crunchy once they’re cooled
        completely. You can also skip this step and use already roasted shelled
        peanuts.
      </li>
      <li>
        Marinate the chicken. Mix together the chicken with all the marinade
        ingredients in a bowl and set aside for 20 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Prepare the sauce. Mix together all the sauce ingredients in a medium
        bowl and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a wok over high heat. Sear the chicken, remove
        from the wok to a bowl, and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Turn the heat to low and add another tablespoon oil. Add the garlic,
        ginger, chilies, Sichuan peppercorn powder, and scallions. Cook for a
        minute or two until fragrant.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the chicken back to the pan and turn up the heat to high. Stir-fry
        for a minute and then use your finger to stir up your prepared sauce
        (the cornstarch will have settled to the bottom, so make sure it’s well
        incorporated). Add the sauce to the wok and stir-fry for another minute.
        The sauce should thicken very quickly.
      </li>
      <li>Finally, add the peanuts. Give everything a final stir and serve.</li>
